RadioTAG Client for Android
===========================

This is an Android RadioTAG client which uses the BBC's prototype server implementation.
There is no guarantee the server will be running or that the client will remain compatible because RadioTAG is currently a draft spec.

RadioTAG is an application of RadioDNS. More information on RadioDNS and RadioTAG can be found at the following URLs:
